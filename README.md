## Deployment Strategy

This project uses Railway for deployment of all microservices. Each service is deployed independently, allowing for:

1. **Independent Scaling**: Each service can be scaled according to its specific needs
2. **Isolated Updates**: Services can be updated without affecting the entire system
3. **Technology Flexibility**: Each service can use the most appropriate technology stack
4. **Simplified CI/CD**: Railway handles the continuous deployment process

### Railway Deployment Process

1. **Service Setup**
   - Create a new project in Railway for each service
   - Connect to the GitHub repository
   - Configure the build settings for each service

2. **Environment Configuration**
   - Set the required environment variables in Railway's dashboard
   - Link shared resources (databases, storage) between services

3. **Custom Domains**
   - Configure custom domains for each service through Railway
   - Set up SSL certificates through Railway's automated system

4. **Monitoring**
   - Use Railway's built-in logs and metrics
   - Set up alerts for service health

For detailed deployment instructions, see [RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md](RAILWAY_DEPLOYMENT.md).

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

- Railway environment variables for service configuration
- `.env.example` as a reference for required variables
- Service-specific configuration in each microservice directory

### Security Best Practices

- Use Railway's secret management for sensitive credentials
- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use SSL/TLS for all services
- Implement rate limiting
- Enable security headers

## Security

### Best Practices

- Use secure password manager for team credentials
- Regularly rotate secrets
- Never commit sensitive data to Git
- Use SSL/TLS in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Enable security headers

### SSL Configuration

- Configure SSL through Railway's custom domain settings
- Ensure all services use HTTPS endpoints
- Configure CORS to allow only trusted origins
- Enable HTTP/2 where supported

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **SSL Certificate Issues**
   - Ensure your Railway custom domains have valid SSL certificates
   - For local development, modern browsers accept localhost connections without HTTPS
   - When deploying to other platforms, use platform-specific SSL certificate setup

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify credentials in Railway environment variables
   - Check database service is running
   - Confirm port availability

3. **OAuth2 Authentication Failures**
   - Verify Google credentials
   - Check redirect URI configuration
   - Confirm SSL certificate validity

### Getting Help

- Check service logs in Railway dashboard
- Review error messages in browser console
- Contact team lead for credential issues

## Enhanced Authentication System

This project implements a robust authentication system using Spring Boot with OAuth2 Resource Server for JWT-based authentication and authorization.

### Features

- JWT-based authentication for API endpoints
- User registration and login with password encryption
- Google OAuth2 login integration
- Token validation and refresh
- Role-based authorization
- CORS configuration for frontend integration

### Security Configuration

The security configuration has been enhanced to use Spring Security's OAuth2 Resource Server capabilities, which provides a standardized way to validate and process JWT tokens.

### Key Components

1. **JwtTokenProvider**: Generates and validates JWT tokens
2. **JwtAuthConverter**: Converts JWT tokens to Spring Security Authentication objects
3. **CustomUserDetailsService**: Loads user details from MongoDB for authentication
4. **SecurityConfig**: Configures security filters, authentication, and authorization rules

### JWT Authentication Flow

The application uses a simplified JWT authentication flow:

1. **User Registration/Login**: User registers or logs in via `/api/auth/signup` or `/api/auth/signin`
2. **Google OAuth**: Alternatively, user can log in via Google OAuth at `/oauth2/authorization/google`
3. **JWT Generation**: On successful authentication, a JWT token is generated
4. **Token Usage**: Frontend stores the token and includes it in the `Authorization` header
5. **Token Validation**: Backend validates the token using the same secret key

### Environment Variables

For correct authentication configuration, set these environment variables in Railway:

| Variable | Description | Required | Default |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `JWT_SECRET` | Secret key for JWT signing | Yes | your-very-long-secret-key-should-be-kept-safe |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` | Google OAuth2 client ID | For OAuth | - |
| `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` | Google OAuth2 client secret | For OAuth | - |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | Comma-separated list of allowed origins | Yes | <http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:19006> |
| `FRONTEND_URL` | URL to redirect after OAuth login | Yes | <http://localhost:3000> |

### Best Practices

- Keep your JWT secret secure and different in each environment
- Make sure the CORS configuration allows your frontend domains
- Set appropriate token expiration (default is 24 hours)
- Use HTTPS in production
