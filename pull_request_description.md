# Authentication System Fixes

## Summary
This pull request addresses several critical issues affecting our authentication system, focusing on frontend-backend connectivity and JWT token generation. The changes span from correcting domain configuration in the frontend to fixing a fundamental JWT signing algorithm mismatch in the backend.

## Changes

### Frontend API URL Configuration
- Updated the domain from `auth-user-api-production.up.railway.app` to `auth-user-service-production.up.railway.app` in:
  - `frontend/services/api.js`
  - `frontend/services/auth.ts`
  - `frontend/app/sign-in.tsx`

### OAuth Authentication Fix
- Fixed TypeScript error in Google OAuth authentication:
  - Updated `handleGoogleAuth()` function in `frontend/services/auth.ts` to handle both array and object return types from `useGoogleAuth()`
  - Added proper error handling for Google auth error object by implementing type safety

### Backend JWT Configuration Fix
- Resolved JWT signing algorithm mismatch in `auth_user_api/src/main/java/group_3/auth_user_api/security/jwt/JwtTokenProvider.java`:
  - Changed signature algorithm from HS512 to HS256 to match the key size (256 bits)
  - This fixed the critical server error: "The signing key's size is 256 bits which is not secure enough for the HS512 algorithm"

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Improved error handling in registration process:
  - Added specific handling for 500 errors with detailed user feedback
  - Implemented better error logging to aid debugging

## Technical Details

### JWT Configuration Issue
The application was experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error during registration due to a mismatch between the JWT signing algorithm and the key size. The error message was:

```
The signing key's size is 256 bits which is not secure enough for the HS512 algorithm. The JWT JWA Specification (RFC 7518, Section 3.2) states that keys used with HS512 MUST have a size >= 512 bits (the key size must be greater than or equal to the hash output size).
```

This was fixed by changing the signature algorithm from HS512 to HS256 in `JwtTokenProvider.java`, ensuring consistency with the existing key size and making it compatible with the JWT specification.

### OAuth Authentication
The TypeScript compiler was reporting errors related to the structure of the `useGoogleAuth()` hook return value:

```
Property 'promptAsync' does not exist on type '[AuthRequest | null, AuthSessionResult | null, (options?: AuthRequestPromptOptions | undefined) => Promise<AuthSessionResult>] | { ...; }'.
```

We implemented a flexible solution that handles both possible return types (array or object) by extracting the `promptAsync` function regardless of the return structure.

## Testing
- Registration functionality now works correctly
- JWT tokens are properly generated and validated
- OAuth authentication process functions as expected
- Frontend successfully communicates with the deployed backend

## Next Steps
- Consider adding more robust error handling for network failures
- Implement a consistent JWT configuration across all services
- Add comprehensive logging for authentication events
- Set up continuous integration tests for authentication flows
